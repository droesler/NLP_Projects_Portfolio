Naive Bayes Language Classifier
---

This project is a Python implementation of a naive Bayesian classifier that classifies fragments of text according to language category. The script builds a set of 15 unigram language models from a set of files containing token counts for 1,500 of the types in each language. The log probability of each sentence (given a language) is generated and output to the console (see image below). The most probable language is also output to the console and labeled as the â€œresult".
To calculate the (smoothed) log probability of each word in the 15 language samples, the following formula was used:
